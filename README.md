# Sequence-Alignment-Project

Programmed efficient algorithm by combining Dynamic Programming and Divide & Conquer
paradigms to compute minimum cost sequence alignment between 2 strings, thereby reducing the space complexity of the plain-DP
algorithm from quadratic to linear. Plotted graphs for analysis of space and time.
